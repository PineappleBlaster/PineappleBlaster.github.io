Basketball nowadays, is a well-known sport that consists of dribbling a ball and shooting it towards a hoop to gain points. This sport originated from <u> <i> James Naismith, </i> </u> the creator of baseketball, in 1891. Comparing current basketball to when James Naismith first created basketball, we can conclude that they were both different and similar. For example, James Naismith first didn't add strings for the net, but instead used a bucket to act as the net. In order for the players to get back the basketball from the net, they would have to climb a ladder and physically remove it from the bucket themselves.
